        "description": "During my Software Engineer Co-op at CIBC, I supported the QA team in writing and maintaining functional test cases for middleware and infrastructure tools. I learned the structure and standards for creating test cases, contributed several that were validated and used by the team, and participated in test reviews to improve quality and coverage. This strengthened my critical thinking and problem-solving skills by anticipating edge cases and identifying potential failures. While I was not directly assigned coding work, I gained exposure to automation scripts and internal workflows, participated in peer reviews, and contributed ideas for potential improvements. I also enhanced my oral communication skills by providing updates in team stand-ups, documenting incidents, and clearly sharing progress with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Feedback from team leads confirmed that my communication was effective and valuable for team alignment.",
        "description2": "CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) is one of Canadaâ€™s largest banks, headquartered in Toronto, serving clients globally with a strong focus on financial services and technology innovation. This co-op term gave me first-hand experience in quality assurance and infrastructure support in a professional banking environment. Through my goals, I developed problem-solving abilities, deepened my understanding of technological literacy, and strengthened oral communication skills. Although I was not able to fully achieve my scripting goal, exposure to automation practices broadened my knowledge of industry standards. Overall, this work term reinforced the importance of collaboration, critical thinking, and adaptability, preparing me for future co-op opportunities and professional roles in software engineering."
